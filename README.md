# ü§ñ Machine Learning Models
Demand Forecasting Model
python# Random Forest implementation for hourly demand prediction
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
features = ['hour', 'day_of_week', 'location_encoded', 'seasonal_factor']
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Model Performance
MAE: 12.5 trips/hour
RMSE: 18.3 trips/hour
R¬≤: 0.847
User Segmentation
python# K-Means clustering for user behavior analysis
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)
user_segments = kmeans.fit_predict(user_features)

# Silhouette Score: 0.73 (Good separation)
